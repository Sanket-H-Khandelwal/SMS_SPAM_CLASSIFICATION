# SMS SPAM CLASSIFICATION

In this project, I have used SMS Spam data and developed the Naïve Baye’s classifier in R. The dataset includes the text of SMS messages along with a label indicating whether the message is wanted or not.

## In R:
It classifies the data by constructing tables of probabilities. The probabilities are calculated using Baye's theorem, which defines how dependent events are associated. Although Bayes' theorem can be computationally expensive we can use the simple version which is the naive version which is used for making assumptions. But we observed that the naive Bayes is more effective when we try to classify text documents.
